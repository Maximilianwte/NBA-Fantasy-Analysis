Analyzing NBA Players for Fantasy Perfomance by Categorie. These Notebooks and Python Scripts mainly use Pandas and Seaborn to peform various calculations and plots of player perfomance.

Strengths:
- Using Data to predict Perfomance

Weaknesses:
- Player Perfomance of season 2017-2018 must not fully correlate perfomance of this season.
- Data could not fully represent the old perfomance due to injuries and coaching decisions to bench players.

## ToDo

- Check the team for calculating each players ranking (If there is another player better or in top 100 get 75% score, if there are 2 give 50%, if there are 4+ give 0%)
- Update more for metrics
